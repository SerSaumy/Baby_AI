Introduction
BabyAI is a project aimed at creating an AI that interacts with the Minecraft world by performing simple actions like moving and mining. The bot starts with no knowledge and learns from its environment, mimicking how a baby would learn.

The idea behind this project is inspired by Emergent Garden, who has his own AI integration system for Minecraft. If you want to see his work, check out his GitHub: Kolbytn.

Setup Guide
To get started with BabyAI, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Node.js: You'll need Node.js to run the Minecraft bot.
Python: Some parts of the AI code are written in Python, so make sure it's installed.
Minecraft: Make sure you have a Minecraft server running. You can use your local machine or set up a LAN server.
Steps
Clone the Repository

Open your terminal/command prompt and clone the BabyAI repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Baby-AI.git
Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:

For Node.js dependencies:

Copy code

Set Up Minecraft Server

Make sure your Minecraft server is running. You can host it on your local machine or set it up over LAN.

Run the Bot

To start the bot, use the following command:

Copy code
node bot.js
The bot will now connect to the Minecraft server and start simulating actions.
