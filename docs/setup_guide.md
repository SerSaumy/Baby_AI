Setup Guide for BabyAI
This guide will help you set up the BabyAI bot for Minecraft.

Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js: The bot uses Node.js, so you need to install it from Node.js official website.

Minecraft Server: You need a running Minecraft server for the bot to connect to. You can set it up locally or use a remote server. If running locally, the default address is localhost and port 25565.

Git: To clone the project repository, make sure you have Git installed. Download it from Git's official website.

Setting Up the Project
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the BabyAI project to your local machine. Open a terminal and run:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Baby-AI.git
Replace your-username with the appropriate GitHub username.

2. Install Dependencies
Next, install the required dependencies. Inside the cloned folder, run the following command in the terminal:

Copy code
npm install
This will install all the required Node.js packages for the bot to work.

3. Update the IP Address (Optional)
By default, the bot will try to connect to localhost (your local machine). If your Minecraft server is hosted on a different machine or has a different IP, update the IP address in the bot.js file:

Open bot.js in a text editor.
Change the line where the IP is defined (usually something like host: 'localhost') to the correct IP address.
Running the Bot
Once everything is set up, you can start the bot. Run the following command:

Copy code
node bot.js
This will start the BabyAI bot and connect it to your Minecraft server. You should see the bot joining the world.

Stopping the Bot
To stop the bot, simply press Ctrl + C in the terminal where the bot is running.
