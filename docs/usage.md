# How to Use BabyAI

After setting up the project, follow these steps to start using BabyAI:

1. **Run the main script**:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
   
2. The AI will begin its learning process, where it will **see** its environment and start interacting with it. 

3. The goal of the AI is to learn how to **mine blocks**, **move**, and **place blocks** to explore and interact with the Minecraft world.

4. You can monitor the AI's progress by watching the game environment or by looking at the logs in the terminal.

## Customization
- You can adjust the behavior of the AI by editing the code in `src/main.py` or by adding more functionality in the `src/ai/` folder.
