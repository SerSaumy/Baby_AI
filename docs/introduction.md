# BabyAI Project Introduction

**BabyAI** is a reinforcement learning project that simulates the learning process of an AI in the Minecraft world. The AI will begin with the ability to **see** its environment and, through exploration, learn to interact with the world by mining, moving, and placing blocks.

The purpose of this project is to simulate the early stages of learning and explore how an AI can adapt and improve through trial and error.

## Features
- AI that learns by seeing the world around it
- Interaction with the Minecraft environment (e.g., mining, moving, placing blocks)
- Reinforcement learning approach

## Goal
To create an AI that can learn autonomously by interacting with the world in a Minecraft environment without prior knowledge.
