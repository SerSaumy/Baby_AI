# **Welcome to BabyAI!**

Welcome to **BabyAI**, a project focused on creating an AI that interacts with the Minecraft world. This AI, like a "baby," has no knowledge of its surroundings and can only **see** the world around it. It learns to perform actions such as moving, mining, and exploring purely through its observations and interactions with the environment.

---

##   **Project Vision:**

The goal of **BabyAI** is to build an AI that starts with **zero knowledge** and evolves over time. The AI learns everything through experience, trial, and error. It will explore the Minecraft world, figuring out how to navigate and perform tasks, all based on **visual input** and **feedback**.

---

##   **Key Features:**

- **  Visual Input**: The AI receives a 3x3 grid as visual data to understand its surroundings.
- ** Reinforcement Learning**: The AI improves over time by learning from its actions and the rewards or penalties it receives.
- ** Minecraft Integration**: The AI interacts with the Minecraft world, gaining experiences and knowledge as it explores.

## **Inspiration:**

This project was inspired by the amazing work of [**Kolbytn**](https://github.com/kolbytn), who has created his own AI integration system for Minecraft. His GitHub repository served as the foundation for **BabyAI**, and we aim to extend his work by developing a unique learning system for our AI.

We hope this project will inspire others to explore the potential of reinforcement learning in dynamic worlds like Minecraft. Feel free to contribute, learn, and grow with BabyAI!
